Everything looks good! Everything ran without issues upon clicking run. I only found the one thing, mentioned below. Great work!

The first thing I've noticed is that in your first part of maize chr seperation, you are filtering chr 2 twice (see below)

```{r}
maize_chr1 <- filter(maize_joined, Chromosome == 2) %>%
arrange(as.numeric(Position))
maize_chr2 <- filter(maize_joined, Chromosome == 2) %>%
arrange(as.numeric(Position))
```
